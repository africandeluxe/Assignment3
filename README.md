# Assignment3
This assignment requires building a Responsive Web game. You could consider adapting assignment 2 to include HTML and CSS.

Your knowledge of the DOM and how to interact with it is being examined in this assignment. Games such as Wordle, Hangman, Memory, Tic Tac Toe and the like are perfect for this assignment, but you are free to create your own game. Having a complex working game is important, but displaying a high understanding of how the three pillars of FE development interact is more important. A (relatively) straight forward memory colour matching game is enough complexity for this assignment.

You can use Vanilla JS or JQuery.
