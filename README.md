# Assignment3
This assignment requires building a Responsive Web game. I could consider adapting assignment 2 to include HTML and CSS.

My knowledge of the DOM and how to interact with it was being examined in this assignment. Games such as Wordle, Hangman, Memory, Tic Tac Toe and the like are perfect for this assignment, but I was free to create my own game. Having a complex working game is important, but displaying a high understanding of how the three pillars of FE development interact is more important. A (relatively) straight forward memory colour matching game is enough complexity for this assignment.

 I could use Vanilla JS or JQuery.
